# SCAMP-C6-Assessment
In the data, we notice that there is a good part that is missing. 
One is tempted to use a regression model or SVM to fill in the box of missing industries. 
However, when reflected on it, the model created will be based on the proportions currently available. 
So the prediction obtained from this model will behave practically
as the available proportions. That is to say, if "marketing"
 appears 35 times on all industries, the model will almost according to this same model. 
We can therefore rely on current data to determine which ones have the most fraudulent offers. 
To do this, we will use the columns of "fraudulent" and "industry". 
We will proceed 0 the deletion of the rows of the missing columns and we will make plots for the visualization.
